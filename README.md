# Earthview Wallpapers
This script runs through a cron script to periodically get new wallpapers from Google Earthview. These images are optimized using imagemagick.

## Requirements:
- curl
- wget
- imagemagick

## Plans:
- Run the images through lutgen to generate both a light and dark themed version for my colorscheme
